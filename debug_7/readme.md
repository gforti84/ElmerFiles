Test case save line over circunferential arc
  
Trying to get saveline to work for the FEMM to Elmer procedure

The case 1 is obtained from a simulation ran in FEMM and converted to Elmer. Please refer to:

[Elmer forum link](https://www.elmerfem.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8094)

Case 1 plot (run case_1/plot_curves.ipynb to replicate)

r = 10 mm:

r = 10.738 mm (air-gap):

r = 12 mm:

The case 2 is from Pavel tutorial for PMSM.
